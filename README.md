# CPP_recursiveDefinitions
  File contains many different algorithms in their recursive forms; asks user for which one they would want to use and will calculate the formula for them. Utilizes thorough unit testing for the user it also can randomly run them for a random unit testing of varying values for each function.

  Needed to use dynamic memory for this to ensure it being leak proof which helped teach me a lot about keeping a personal documentation on new variables and their nullptr counterparts.

**The Breakdown:**

  This Program Outlines 5 Recursive Problems To Be Solved In C++.

  This Program Assesses knowledge of recursive data structures by
 displaying different ways it can arise and be used. This assignment
 calls for 5 functions, each with their own goal; one being calculations
 of a unknown algorithm's sequencing to a n'th position. Secondly,
 having a function which calculates the amount of tennis balls needed to
 make a pyramid of x height. Thirdly is a conversion from base 10 integers
 to base 2. Fourth program checks the divisibility of a integer based
 on a recursive function which refrains from the usage of modulo until 
 certain criterium are satisfied. Finally is the ramunjan calculation,
 which calls for you to represent the algorithm in a recursive function.
 These are finally used with unit test functions which check their outputs
 at varying values.
